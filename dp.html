				<strong><u><i>Bishnupur Durga Puja:-</i></u></strong>
			</h3>
			<p>A brave hunter during his hunting expedition in the dense forest surrounding erstwhile Bonbishnupur (now Bishnupur) was enamoured by the sight of a beautiful deer. He chased the wild game desperately to make his day�s expedition fruitful. But to his utter astonishment, not only did the illusive deer vanish in the bush; the hunter also lost his way in the dense forest where even the rays of the sun could not penetrate. There were many surprises in store for the hunter.<br>

The hunting hawk that accompanied him in his expedition stirred in excitement seeing a heron and inspired by its basic instinct chased it. But the hunter could not believe his eyes when the hawk was found being chased by the heron. When the hunter was in deep speculation about such uncanny events, he heard an oracle uttered in a female voice:<br>

�This is the holy place where I exist. Shift your capital here. You will find a minuscule shape of my countenance once the soil here is dug up. And also set up a temple of mine here.�<br>
As per the legend handed down from generation to generation among the people of Bishnupur, the courageous hunter who heard that divine voice was no other than Jagatmalla, the 19th king of the Bagdi Malla Dynasty. He reigned over Mallabhum from 994-1007 CE. The divine voice was of Ma Jagadamba, another name of Goddess Durga. She directed Jagatmalla to shift his capital from Pradyumnapur to Bonbishnupur and set up the temple of Maa Mrinmoyee Devi another name of Goddess Durga. The small countenance that the king found after digging the soil was heard to be embedded in the idol of Maa Mrinmoyee which was made of Ganga clay.<br>

According to the pundits and local historians the building of the capital town Bishnupur and the establishment of Maa Mrinmoyee Devi were done simultaneously.  Earlier a humble hut made of clay walls with shed was dedicated to Maa Mrinmoyee. Later Ramkrishna Singha Dev, the 59th king of Mallabhum, who ruled from 1876 CE to 1885 CE, built the existing building-temple.   Naturally, Maa Mrinmoyee Devi became the tutelary goddess of the Malla Dynasty. It is accepted by most of the historians that the temple of Maa Mrinmoyee Devi was established in 997 CE. So, there is little doubt about the fact that the Durga Puja of Maa Mrinmoyee Devi temple is the oldest one in Bengal and perhaps in India.
