		<p>The Conch shell industry is very famous in Bankura district. The people known as ‘Shankhabaniks’ or ‘Sankharis’ used to make designer conch bangles or ‘Sankha’ for married Hindu ladies. They also manufacture different types of blowing conches using intricate patterns and designs. The skilled artisans beautifully design miniature forms of Gods and Goddess also. Wood carved items consist of different types of images, idols, toys and other decorative products. Bankura and Bishnupur are those places where you will find the talented wood artisans.
