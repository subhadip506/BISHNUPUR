				<strong><u><i>Pora Maatir Haat :-</i></u></strong>
			</h3>
			<p>Haat boshechhe shukrobare bakshiganj e padma paarey…. The famous lines of Rabindranath Tagore’s Sahaj Path, celebrating the myriad hues of a rural marketplace of Bengal. Such haats have the rustic charm of the state’s simple village folk, as they buy and sell in these weekly haats, anything from foodgrains, vegetables, livestock and even their own hand-made articles. Bengal’s haats are a meeting place for traders, potters, farmers, simple village women and even artisans.</br>
We are all familiar with Santiniketan’s Shonibarer Haat, that attracts a huge inflow of tourists from the city every weekend. Keeping in mind it’s success, a new form of Haat has recently been introduced in Bishnupur. It is aptly named as Poramatir Haat, as Bishnupur is famous for its terracotta or burnt clay and brick artefacts, dolls, statues and much more. The main purpose of this Haat is to promote and market the terracotta art of Bishnupur and the culture of entire Bankura district. </br>
Every Saturday the Poramatir Haat beyond the Chhinnamasta Temple of Bishnupur, on an open ground infront of Jora Mandir is a treat to the senses. It starts at noon and runs till evening. One can find anything and everything artistic at the Haat. Be it the terracotta shops, pora maatir jewellery, stone shops of Susunia hills, paper doll shops, wooden goods shops, handmade “jurugunda” shrimps (chorakata) and lantern shops --- all speak of the indigenous art and crafts of this region.<br>
If you want to take a double-decker bicycle to visit the fair, you will get the vehicle on rent. But you must not miss Bishnupur’s Pora Maatir Haat, that throws up the vivid colours of ‘Rarh-Bengal’ at its best.
